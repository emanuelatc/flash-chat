# Flash Chat ⚡️- Emanuela Sîrcă (Tudose)

Flash Chat is a messaging app where users can sign up and log in to chat.

I created this application following the officially recommended course by Flutter found on [The App Brewery](https://www.appbrewery.co/p/flutter-development-bootcamp-with-dart) website.

The Flash Chat application tutorial and challenges can be found in the 15th section of the course.
